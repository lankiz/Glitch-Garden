 ### About the Project
 
 
 This project was built by Leonid Sorkin.
 The goal of this project was to create a game similar to Plants VS Zombies, using the assets taken from [Glitch](https://www.glitchthegame.com/). In order to do that I had to apply the intermediate knowledge of C#, Unity and object oriented programming.It was the final project of the course. Some of the things I did during the project:
 <ul>
   <li>Created animations with animation events and assigned them to objects using C# scripts</li>
   <li>Set up attacker spawners using coroutines</li>
 <li>Setting up damage, projectile and health components</li>
 <li>Create a grid to be able to spawn defenders only at specific coordinates</li>
 <li>Implemented a resource system, so that player would be able to buy defenders using resources he collected during the game</li>
 <li>Added different animation events when attacker collides with a defender</li>
 <li>Set up the level timer and a game over experience</li>
 <li>Created an options screen for the player to be able to save PlayerPrefs for volume and difficulty</li>
 <li>Added a Splash Screen and sound for the game to look like a game</li>
 
 </ul>
